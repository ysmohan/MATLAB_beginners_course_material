%% Loops Challenge

% Using the worked example as a guide, write a script that will calculate
% the maximum of mass of the meteorite hitting each continent and display it.

% Calculate the minimum and maximum for all the continents with odd
% indices.
% Change your loop so that you only display the minimum and maximum for
% continents 1,2,4 and 7.

%% Extension Challenge

% Use a for loop to loop through each continent and generate a scatter plot
% of the latitude v longitude on the same plot. Set the size of each of the
% data point as mass/10000.
