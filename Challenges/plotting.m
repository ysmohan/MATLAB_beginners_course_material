%% Challenge 4 - Plot the data
% In this section we will explore the data we just analysed by plotting it.
% Being able to visualise data is an important part of research. Look 
% through the help documentation for the plot function. The command window 
% also has a 'Plots' section in the toolstrip. Look through this.       

%% A scatter plot to show all the data
% Using the 'scatter' and the 'hold' functions, plot the latitude and
% longitudes for all the continents on the same graph.


%% Plotting specific parameters

% In a separate plot, using the 'plot' function, plot the mean mass of
% meteorites to hit each continent (use the 'plot' function).

%% Saving the plot

% Save the plots as png files.
